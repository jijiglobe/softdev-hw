# 1.62X10ToThe11

1.62X10ToThe11 is a storyboard where users can add an sentence to existing stories or start a new story of their own.

###Origin of project name
3 out of 4 of us in the group have Acer C720, and (3/4)\*72\**c* is 1.62\*10^11.  
The carrot didn't work when we were creating the repository.  
So we're 1.62X10ToThe11. :D
